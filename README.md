  <li>Progress Report One (9/15/2019)
    <ul>
      <li> Briefly describe your project. (About 2 sentences.) </li>
        <ul><li> My project is a web site for a truck dealership in Fort Myers, Florida. The website will feature current inventory, contact information, and general financing information. The website will also feature a log in for the dealership so they can log in and update their inventory.</li></ul>
      <li> What is your particular role in the project?</li>
        <ul><li> I am the only member of my group so my role is all encompassing. </li></ul>
      <li> What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?</li>
        <ul><li> During the past two weeks, I had another requirement gathering conversation with the customer to try to better refine their needs. I also did a lot of research on the Vue JS framework and Entity framework. I plan on using Entity framework to communicate between the MVC webapp and the SQL database. Vue JS framework is a common JS framework but it was relatively unknown to me. I will most likely be implementing Vue JS on this project. </li></ul>
      <li> Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.</li>
        <ul><li> Significant progress includes the additional requirement gathering, research, and the initial bare build of the web application. </li></ul>

      <li> What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?</li>
        <ul><li> During the past two weeks I started the actual build of the project. Through Visual Studio I created a new MVC 5 project and established a log-in for the client. I set up the basis for a landing page, an 'About us' page, and a contact page. I also set up the log-in page. I continued to learned more about Vue JS and its viability with this project. Im still working on finding the best way to store many images in a SQL Server database. </li></ul>

      <li> What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?</li>
        <ul><li> These past two weeks were research and discussion heavy. I consulted several professional and experienced web developers and asked them for their suggestions and advice as how best to implement the dashboard, photo galleries, photo uploads, and database implementation for the photos. I began work on the front end of the website to outline the basics of where everything will go for the first draft. I contacted the customer and asked for the needed data and pictures to begin populating the database. </li></ul>

      <li> Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.</li>
        <ul><li> During these past two weeks, I wired up the database to the MVC project. I initialized the datatables framework for the front end of the website to display the database information. I discussed with others about possibilities for storing images. I have been debating storing the images in the database vs storing the images in a file structure and just storing the file paths in the database. Due to the small amount of images that we will be storing, I decided to go through with just storing the images in the database. </li></ul>

        <ul><li> During these past two weeks I continued to work on the Javascript upload. I got the look and feel of the uploader correct but there is a bug where the files are being uploaded but not showing on the UI. I will continue to work on this bug to get the uploader 100% operational. </li></ul>
