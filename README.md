  <li>Progress Report One (9/15/2019)
    <ul>
      <li> Briefly describe your project. (About 2 sentences.) </li>
        <ul><li> My project is a web site for a truck dealership in Fort Myers, Florida. The website will feature current inventory, contact information, and general financing information. The website will also feature a log in for the dealership so they can log in and update their inventory.</li></ul>
      <li> What is your particular role in the project?</li>
        <ul><li> I am the only member of my group so my role is all encompassing. </li></ul>
      <li> What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?</li>
        <ul><li> During the past two weeks, I had another requirement gathering conversation with the customer to try to better refine their needs. I also did a lot of research on the Vue JS framework and Entity framework. I plan on using Entity framework to communicate between the MVC webapp and the SQL database. Vue JS framework is a common JS framework but it was relatively unknown to me. I will most likely be implementing Vue JS on this project. </li></ul>
      <li> Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.</li>
        <ul><li> Significant progress includes the additional requirement gathering, research, and the initial bare build of the web application. </li></ul>
